attack_docs: "\n        Apply a perspective transform to the image so it looks like\

  \ your phone of a\n        picture on a computer).\n\n        @param image: PIL\
  \ Image to be augmented\n\n        @param metadata: if set to be a list, metadata\
  \ about the function execution\n            including its name, the source & dest\
  \ width, height, etc. will be appended to\n            the inputted list. If set\
  \ to None, no metadata will be appended or returned\n\n        @param bboxes: a\
  \ list of bounding boxes can be passed in here if desired. If\n            provided,\
  \ this list will be modified in place such that each bounding box is\n         \
  \   transformed according to this function\n\n        @param bbox_format: signifies\
  \ what bounding box format was used in `bboxes`. Must\n            specify `bbox_format`\
  \ if `bboxes` is provided. Supported bbox_format values\n            are \"pascal_voc\"\
