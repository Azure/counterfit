attack_docs: "\n        Shuffles the pixels of an image with respect to the shuffling\
  \ factor. The\n        factor denotes percentage of pixels to be shuffled and randomly\
  \ selected\n        Note: The actual number of pixels will be less than the percentage\
  \ given\n        due to the probability of pixels staying in place in the course\
  \ of shuffling\n\n        @param image: PIL Image to be augmented\n\n        @param\
  \ metadata: if set to be a list, metadata about the function execution\n       \
  \     including its name, the source & dest width, height, etc. will be appended\
  \ to\n            the inputted list. If set to None, no metadata will be appended\
  \ or returned\n\n        @param bboxes: a list of bounding boxes can be passed in\
  \ here if desired. If\n            provided, this list will be modified in place\
  \ such that each bounding box is\n            transformed according to this function\n\
  \n        @param bbox_format: signifies what bounding box format was used in `bboxes`.\
  \ Must\n            specify `bbox_format` if `bboxes` is provided. Supported bbox_format\
  \ values\n            are \"pascal_voc\", \"pascal_voc_norm\", \"coco\", and \"\
