  \    (2019).\n\n    Word-level Textual Adversarial Attacking as Combinatorial Optimization.\n\
  \n    https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.540.pdf\n\n    Methodology\
  \ description quoted from the paper:\n\n    \"We propose a novel word substitution-based\
  \ textual attack model, which reforms\n    both the aforementioned two steps. In\
  \ the first step, we adopt a sememe-based word\n    substitution strategy, which\
  \ can generate more candidate adversarial examples with\n    better semantic preservation.\
  \ In the second step, we utilize particle swarm optimization\n    (Eberhart and\
  \ Kennedy, 1995) as the adversarial example searching algorithm.\"\n\n    And \"\
  Following the settings in Alzantot et al. (2018), we set the max iteration time\
  \ G to 20.\"\n    "
